# twitify

This Python program was written in Spyder in Anaconda, but it can be run in any IDE or from the command line. 

It uses regular Python libraries except for its APIs. 

This program uses spotipy (https://github.com/plamere/spotipy/) and twitter-python (https://github.com/bear/python-twitter), which both need to be installed for it to run. 

It has no dependencies on external dataset files
